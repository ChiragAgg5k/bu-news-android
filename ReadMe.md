# BU-News-Android 

This Android programme was created with Bennett University students in mind. It offers up-to-date information on events 
as they are happening in addition to other news items like student accomplishments, newsletters, club registration forms,
and much more. It attempts to address the institution's present decentralised news distribution system, which frequently 
results in issues like news not reaching all students, the proliferation of fake news, or events being pushed by 
businesses with no connection to the university.
